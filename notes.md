Roughly working!

- Needs work on the correct filename
- Haven't implemented tags, will go with artist and title for mvp
- Havent implemented thumbnail, they are contained in track data though

## Pending items that should work separately

- Extract correct title and artist
- Extract live indication eg Live from Abbey Road
- Since youtube is a chaos, maybe emit extractions as recommendations and user can edit on the fly
- Get artist title from description on it contains "Auto-generated by YouTube."
- Use Spotify API for metadata -> search track on spotify to get tags
