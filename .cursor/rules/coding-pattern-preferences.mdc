# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid having files over 300 lines of code, refactor accordingly to keep size small
- Do not use packages that are not installed already in the project. Always rely on the existing ones
- If there is a folder with tests, add new testing there instead of creating new files
